The AI engineer's journey with ConfesApp has involved significant bug fixes, architectural refactoring, and feature development. Initially, the focus was on resolving critical issues: a  on  deletion, a frontend date parsing error (), and broken frontend delete/cancel buttons. These were systematically diagnosed and fixed by modifying backend deletion logic to cascade cancel confessions, converting date strings to  objects, and correcting frontend API calls and  usage.

A major architectural shift occurred with the complete modularization of the frontend from a monolithic  into a feature-based structure, mirroring the backend. This involved creating dedicated folders for features, navigation, state, and UI components. Concurrently, a database migration to Supabase/PostgreSQL was attempted but faced connectivity issues, leading to a robust fallback mechanism to SQLite and a refactor of entity date types for dual compatibility.

More recently, the AI engineer integrated React Router for modern URL-based navigation and refined the Priest Dashboard, fixing edit/delete functionality in list views and creating four new essential screens (, , , ) with a consistent minimalist design. The immediate next step is to integrate these new screens into the application's navigation.

<product_requirements>
ConfesApp is a multi-role Catholic web application for scheduling confessions, supporting Faithful, Priest, Bishop, Parish, Staff, and Admin roles. It features a modern, liturgical design. Core functionalities include priest registration via invitation or direct application, and the Franjas de Confesión system, enabling priests to define recurring availability and manage capacity. Faithful can book and cancel citas, while Priests/Coordinators can manage franjas. Recent enhancements include robust role-based access, improved login/navigation, and a new Coordinadores management section. Key bug fixes included resolving  constraints on  deletion and various frontend rendering/date parsing issues. The application has been significantly refactored for a scalable, modular frontend architecture and prepared for Supabase PostgreSQL integration, though currently falling back to SQLite. Newly requested screens include Confession Confirmation (Faithful), Confession Request Detail (Priest), Unauthorized Access Error, and a Confession History (both roles), all to follow a minimalist, soft-colored visual style.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Backend**: NestJS, TypeORM (SQLite/PostgreSQL fallback), JWT authentication, Role-based Guards.
-   **Frontend**: React, React Router, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, Axios, .
-   **Architecture**: Full-stack, RESTful API, feature-based modular design (frontend), hybrid database, hierarchical role management.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application utilizes a React frontend and a NestJS backend.

**Directory Structure (after modularization):**


**Key Files and Their Importance:**

*   **/app/backend/src/confession-bands/confession-bands.service.ts**: Manages  CRUD. **Changed**: Modified  method to first cancel all associated  to resolve  errors upon deletion.
*   **/app/backend/src/confessions/confessions.service.ts**: Handles confession logic. **Changed**: Modified  to distinguish between  and  for accurate cancellation.
*   **/app/backend/src/app.module.ts**: NestJS root module. **Changed**: Configured TypeORM to support both PostgreSQL (Supabase) and SQLite with a fallback mechanism by dynamically setting  and  options based on environment variables.
*   **/app/backend/src/entities/\*.entity.ts**: All entity files (e.g., , , ). **Changed**: Updated date/time columns from  to  and added  for / columns to ensure compatibility across SQLite and PostgreSQL.
*   **/app/frontend/src/App.js**: The main React application component. **Extensively refactored**: From a monolithic file containing all UI logic to a minimal wrapper initializing , , , and .
*   **/app/frontend/src/navigation/AppRouter.js (NEW)**: Centralizes frontend routing logic using React Router. Defines routes for , , , , , and placeholder routes for new screens.
*   **/app/frontend/src/store/auth/AuthProvider.js (NEW)**: Provides global authentication context. **Changed**: Fixed a loading state bug that prevented routes from rendering initially.
*   **/app/frontend/src/features/**: New top-level directory for modularizing frontend by feature. Each feature (e.g., , , ) contains its , , , and .
*   **/app/frontend/src/features/bands/screens/PriestDashboard.js**: **Changed**: Refactored to properly pass  and  functions to , and replaced  with an internal state-managed confirmation modal for band deletion.
*   **/app/frontend/src/features/confessions/screens/ConfessionConfirmationScreen.js (NEW)**, ,  and : These are newly created UI components implementing the user's requested screens with the specified minimalist design.
*   **/app/frontend/package.json**:  was added as a dependency for the new routing system.
*   **/app/test_result.md**: Continuously updated log for tracking issues, test results, and agent communications.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer addressed a user-reported issue with the Priest Dashboard: the edit and delete buttons in the list view were not functioning, and the create band button in the calendar view opened the modal correctly. The AI engineer diagnosed the issue, finding that the delete functionality was blocked by  (a browser security feature in the sandboxed environment). This was fixed by replacing  with an internal state-managed confirmation modal within . Additionally, the AI engineer created four new screens as per user request: , , , and , adhering to a specified minimalist visual style. The Priest Dashboard's edit/delete functionality is now confirmed fixed, and the new screens have been successfully created. The current state is that the application is functional, the frontend is modularized, and the Priest Dashboard is fully operational. The new screens exist but are not yet integrated into the navigation.
