The AI engineer successfully transitioned ConfesApp from MVP to a more robust application, navigating several technical challenges. Initially, the core ConfesApp was built with NestJS/TypeORM/SQLite (after Supabase connectivity issues) for a basic Fiel/Sacerdote role system. The engineer then implemented the full ecclesiastical hierarchy and enhanced authentication. A major focus was the Priest Registration feature, encompassing bishop invitations and direct applications. A significant hurdle was resolving a supervisor configuration error causing the NestJS backend to run with uvicorn, which was debugged and fixed with the . Subsequently, the frontend role selection was simplified, and the priest login flow optimized. Most recently, the application's terminology was updated from slot to cita, and the Franjas de Confesión feature, including a new  entity and related backend logic, was initiated.

ConfesApp is a web application enabling Catholics to find, schedule, and prepare for confession, supporting multiple user roles: Faithful, Priest, Parish Staff, Bishop, and Admin. The design emphasizes a modern, clean, minimal aesthetic with a liturgical color palette (violet, blue, gold, ivory), Poppins typography, Framer Motion animations, and dark mode, supporting both mobile and desktop.

Initial MVP focused on: Basic Fiel/Priest roles, Priest creating confession slots, and Faithful viewing/booking slots.

Post-MVP additions:
1.  **Full Ecclesiastical Hierarchy**: Backend entities and frontend components for Bishop, Diocese, Parish, Parish Staff, and Admin roles.
2.  **Priest Registration Flows**:
    *   **Invitation by Bishop**: Bishops invite priests via email; priests register using a token, automatically assigned to diocese/parish.
    *   **Direct Priest Application**: Priests apply directly, entering details and selecting diocese/parish; requests are  by a Bishop.
3.  **Frontend Simplification**: Eliminated public registration options for Obispo and Coordinador Parroquial, streamlining role selection to Fiel and Sacerdote only.
4.  **Optimized Priest Login**: Introduced an intermediate screen for priests to choose between Iniciar sesión (direct login) or Registrarse (invitation/direct application).
5.  **Terminology Update**: Replaced slot with cita across the application, especially in priest and faithful dashboards.
6.  **Franjas de Confesión Feature**: Priests can define recurring or unique franjas (bands) of availability with start/end times, location, notes, and maximum capacity. The system needs to support CRUD operations for these bands and manage their status (available, full, canceled).

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently in the process of implementing the Franjas de Confesión (Confession Bands) functionality, which is a significant new feature for priests. This involves creating a system for priests to define recurring or unique periods of availability for confession.

**Backend progress:**
*   A new  entity () has been created to store details like start/end times, location, capacity, recurrence, and associated priest/parish.
*   The existing  entity () has been modified to link to  using .
*   New DTOs for  operations (, , ) have been created.
*   A new  module, including  (to encapsulate business logic for CRUD operations, status changes, and overlap validation) and  (to expose RESTful endpoints), has been set up.
*   The  has been registered in .
*   The backend has been successfully compiled and restarted, indicating that the new  related entities, DTOs, services, and controllers are integrated without compilation errors.

**Frontend progress:**
*   Initial frontend components for the Franjas de Confesión feature have been created:
    *   : Intended for displaying the priest's confession bands in a weekly calendar view.
    *   : Designed for the creation and editing of new confession bands, including date/time pickers and recurrence options.
*   The user requested to continue with the dashboard of the priest integrated with these new functionalities.

The immediate step was to create the backend components for  and then proceed to the frontend. The backend compilation succeeded, and the engineer moved to create frontend components for the new feature.
