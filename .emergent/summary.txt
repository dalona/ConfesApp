The AI engineer successfully transitioned ConfesApp from MVP to a more robust application, navigating several technical challenges. Initially, the core ConfesApp was built, and then Franjas de Confesión feature, including a new  entity and related backend logic, was initiated. The AI engineer has been meticulously addressing various bugs and implementing new features. Key challenges involved resolving frontend JSON parsing and modal display issues, fixing a critical database schema conflict (making  nullable and unifying confession services for hybrid data), and rectifying a Cannot read properties of null frontend error through defensive programming and helper functions. Most recently, after implementing priest coordinator management and completing several testing cycles, a critical bug emerged where  operations on  were failing due to a  in the backend. The AI engineer has correctly diagnosed this as requiring a modification to the backend deletion logic to first cancel associated confessions.

<product_requirements>
ConfesApp is a multi-role Catholic web app for scheduling confessions with a modern, liturgical design. Starting from basic Faithful/Priest MVP, it evolved to include a full ecclesiastical hierarchy (Bishop, Parish, Staff, Admin) and sophisticated priest registration (invitation-based or direct application with approval). Frontend role selection was simplified, and priest login optimized. Terminology shifted from slot to cita. A major feature, Franjas de Confesión, allows priests to define recurring availability with capacity, supporting CRUD operations and status management. Recent work expanded to implement robust role-based access, improved login/navigation for Faithful/Priests, and enabled editing/cancelling  for Faithful and  for Priests/Coordinators, along with a new Coordinadores management section in the Priest Dashboard.

-   **Backend**: NestJS, TypeORM, SQLite, JWT authentication, Role-based Guards, DTOs, Bcryptjs.
-   **Frontend**: React, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, Axios, , , .
-   **Architecture**: Full-stack, RESTful API, hierarchical role management, modular design, hybrid system for legacy and new confession entities.

The application features a React frontend and a NestJS backend.

**Directory Structure:**


**Key Files and Their Importance:**

*   **/app/backend/src/app.module.ts**: Root NestJS module. It imports  and , integrating these new features into the application's overall structure.
*   **/app/backend/src/entities/confession.entity.ts**: Defines the  database schema. **Changed**: The  field was made . This change was critical to resolve a  error, allowing the system to support a hybrid model where confessions can be linked to either legacy  or the new  entities.
*   **/app/backend/src/confessions/confessions.service.ts**: Contains the business logic for managing confessions. **Changed**: The , , and  methods were modified to intelligently handle both  (legacy) and  (new) for booking, retrieving, and cancelling confessions. This ensures compatibility and proper resource management across both systems.
*   **/app/backend/src/confessions/confessions.module.ts**: The NestJS module for confessions. **Changed**:  was injected into this module, establishing a dependency for cross-service interaction, particularly when managing confessions related to bands.
*   **/app/backend/src/confessions/dto/create-confession.dto.ts**: Data Transfer Object for creating confessions. **Changed**: Modified to allow either  or  to be provided, aligning with the hybrid confession system.
*   **/app/backend/src/confession-bands/**: This is a **NEW** module. It defines the  entity, along with its dedicated service, controller, and DTOs (, , ). This module is fundamental for the Franjas de Confesión feature, enabling priests to define and manage their recurring confession availability.
*   **/app/frontend/src/App.js**: The main React application component. **Extensively changed**:
    *   Integrated  and  into the  for confession band management.
    *   Implemented  for improved faithful login/registration flow.
    *   Incorporated  component and logic for role-based route protection and redirection post-login.
    *   Added functionalities for faithful to cancel their  and for priests to edit/delete their .
    *   Introduced helper functions (, ) to abstract and correctly display data from both  and  entities.
    *   Improved API error handling and added defensive rendering checks (e.g., null/undefined filtering) to enhance frontend robustness.
    *   Added a new Coordinadores management section within , including a  modal for inviting parish coordinators.
*   **/app/frontend/src/WeeklyCalendar.js (NEW)**: A frontend component specifically for priests to visualize their  in a weekly calendar format.
*   **/app/frontend/src/BandForm.js (NEW)**: A frontend form component for priests to create and edit the details of , including recurrence.
*   **/app/frontend/src/CoordinatorRegister.js (NEW)**: A dedicated component for the process of a parish coordinator accepting an invitation. It has been created but not yet fully integrated into the main application routing.
*   **/app/frontend/package.json**: The  and  libraries were installed to support date and time selection functionalities in frontend forms.
*   **/app/test_result.md**: This file is critical for tracking progress. It contains the testing protocol, user problem statements, and is continuously updated with test results and agent communications, serving as a project log.

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently addressing a critical backend issue: the inability to delete a  if it has associated , due to a  error in SQLite. This was identified after the user reported that the delete buttons for both priests (for ) and faithful (for ) were not working, despite previous backend tests showing the API endpoints were functional. The discrepancy was traced to an Internal server error (500) originating from the backend when triggered by the frontend. The immediate task is to modify the backend service responsible for deleting  to first cancel all related  before attempting to delete the band itself, ensuring referential integrity. This is the last action before the summary request.

<optional_next_step>
Modify the backend  to cancel all associated  before deleting a  to resolve the  error.
