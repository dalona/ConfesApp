The AI engineer successfully refactored the frontend into a modular, feature-based architecture and integrated React Router for navigation. Initial efforts focused on fixing critical bugs, including  constraints and frontend date parsing issues. The trajectory shows the systematic development of new screens for different roles. The Bishop Dashboard was fully implemented, including UI components and backend integration. A shared Parish Dashboard was then developed for Priests and Coordinators, although initial access was problematic due to frontend refresh/routing issues, which were eventually resolved by direct URL access and service restarts. Subsequently, the Admin Dashboard was fully implemented structurally, including its components and routes, but the creation of an admin user in the database via seeding faced  and  errors, leaving the user creation pending. The very last interaction involves a user request to change the homepage image and application logo, which the AI acknowledged. The project has progressed significantly in establishing a robust, role-based application with comprehensive dashboards.

<product_requirements>
ConfesApp is a multi-role Catholic web application enabling faithful to schedule/cancel confessions (citas) and priests/coordinators to manage recurring availability (franjas). The application supports Faithful, Priest, Bishop, Parish Staff, and Admin roles, aiming for a modern, liturgical, minimalist design. Key features include priest registration, robust role-based access, and a modular architecture. Recent requests included four new screens: Confession Confirmation (Faithful), Confession Request Detail (Priest), Unauthorized Access, and Confession History (both roles). The user then requested a Bishop Dashboard (view/manage priests, oversee confession bands, statistics, manage parishes/staff) and later a Coordinator Dashboard, which evolved into a shared Parish Dashboard for Priests and Coordinators with permissions refined to give priests full parish visibility. Finally, an Admin Dashboard (global view, diocese/user management, system configuration, reports) was requested and implemented. The current immediate request is to update the homepage image and application logo.

-   **Backend**: NestJS, TypeORM (SQLite/PostgreSQL fallback), JWT authentication, Role-based Guards.
-   **Frontend**: React, React Router, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, Axios, .
-   **Architecture**: Full-stack, RESTful API, feature-based modular design (frontend), hybrid database, hierarchical role management.

<code_architecture>
The application uses a React frontend and a NestJS backend. The frontend is modularized into  folders, mirroring backend modules.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer completed the implementation of the **Admin Dashboard**. This involved creating  along with five sub-components: , , , , and . The routes for the Admin Dashboard were successfully added to  and the  was updated to ensure the  role is directed to . An attempt was made to add an admin user to the database via  to facilitate testing, but this resulted in a  (foreign key constraint) and  errors, leaving the admin user uncreated. When trying to access the Admin Dashboard, the system redirected to the homepage, indicating a lack of proper admin authentication due to the uncreated user. The AI confirmed the Admin Dashboard is 100% implemented in terms of code and structure, but access is blocked by the missing admin user. The very last interaction is a user request to change the homepage image and application logo, to which the AI has just acknowledged and is starting to investigate the file locations.
